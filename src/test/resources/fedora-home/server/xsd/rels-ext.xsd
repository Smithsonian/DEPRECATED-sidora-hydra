About this Schema:
  This schema describes the "RELS-EXT" format, which is a specialization of
  RDF/XML used by "RELS-EXT" datastreams in Fedora.  Datastreams in this
  format have FORMAT_URI "info:fedora/fedora-system:FedoraRELSExt-1.0".

Syntax:
  The root element, [RDF], must contain exactly one [Description] element
  with an "about" attribute.  The [Description] element may contain any
  number of child elements from any namespace.  Each such element may
  have an rdf:resource attribute, an rdf:datatype attribute, or text
  content.
  
  Note that the RELS-EXT format is not fully expressable in the W3C XML Schema
  language.  Additional restrictions on this format are documented in the
  javadocs for RelsExtValidator.
